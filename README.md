# Calculator Project

This is a simple calculator project implemented in JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations and a user-friendly interface for performing calculations.

## Features

- Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/) operations.
- Clear button (C) to reset the input and result fields.
- Undo button to remove the last entered character or operation.
- Error handling for division by zero and other calculation errors.
- Additional line for arithmetic operations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How to Use

- Click on the number buttons to input numbers.
- Click on the operation buttons (+, -, \*, /) to perform calculations.
- Use the clear (C) button to reset the input and result fields.
- The undo button removes the last entered character or operation.
- Press the equal (=) button to calculate the result.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the calculator interface.
- `styles.css`: Provides styling for the calculator interface.
- `script.js`: Implements the calculator logic using JavaScript.

## Implementation Details

- The calculator logic is implemented using event listeners for button clicks.
- Numbers and operations are appended to the calculation input field.
- The equal button triggers the calculation of the expression entered.
- Error handling is implemented to catch division by zero and other calculation errors.
